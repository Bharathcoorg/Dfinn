## Build the with Dfinn Node üíÉ

To build Dfinn, you will need a proper Substrate development environment. If you need a refresher setting up your Substrate environment, see [Substrate's Getting Started Guide](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/).


```bash
# Fetch the code
git clone https://github.com/Bharathcoorg/Dfinn.git
cd Dfinn

# Build the node (The first build will be long (~30min))
cargo build --release
```

If a cargo not found error shows up in the terminal, manually add Rust to your system path (or restart your system):

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Then, you will want to run the node in dev mode using the following command:

```bash
./target/release/dfinn-node --dev
```

> For people not familiar with Substrate, the --dev flag is a way to run a Substrate-based node in a single node developer configuration for testing purposes. You can learn more about `--dev` in [this Substrate tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/interact).

When running a node via the binary file, data is stored in a local directory typically located in ~/.local/shared/polkadex-node/chains/development/db. If you want to start a fresh instance of the node, you can either delete the content of the folder, or run the following command inside the dfinn folder:

```bash
./target/release/dfinn-node purge-chain --dev
```

This will remove the data folder, note that all chain data is now lost.

## Run a local network (two nodes)

- Install `subkey`, `jq`
```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s --
brew install jq
```

- Generate node key using `subkey`
```bash
Alice_Node_Key=$(subkey generate --scheme Ed25519 --output-type Json | jq -r '.secretSeed')
```

- Run Alice's node

```bash
# Purge any chain data from previous runs
./target/release/dfinn-node purge-chain --base-path /tmp/alice --chain local

# Start Alice's node
./target/release/dfinn-node --base-path /tmp/alice \
  --chain local \
  --alice \
  --port 30333 \
  --ws-port 9945 \
  --rpc-port 9933 \
  --node-key $Alice_Node_Key \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

Local node identity is: 12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp shows the Peer ID that Bob will need when booting from Alice's node. This value was determined by the --node-key that was used to start Alice's node.

Now that Alice's node is up and running, Bob can join the network by bootstrapping from her node.
```bash
./target/release/dfinn-node purge-chain --base-path /tmp/bob --chain local
./target/release/dfinn-node \
  --base-path /tmp/bob \
  --chain local \

```

If all is going well, after a few seconds, the nodes should peer together and start producing blocks. You should see some lines like the following in the console that started Alice node.

## Using docker

The following commands will setup a local dfinn network made of 2 nodes. It's using the node key (0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001). But you should generate your own node key using the subkey as the above.

```bash
docker build . -t dfinn-node
docker-compose -f 2nodes.yml up --force-recreate
```

## Connecting Polkadot JS Apps to a Local Node
The development node is a Substrate-based node, so you can interact with it using standard Substrate tools. The two provided RPC endpoints are:
- HTTP: `http://127.0.0.1:9933`
- WS: `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`

Start by connecting to it with Polkadot JS Apps. Open a browser to: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer. This will open Polkadot JS Apps, which automatically connects to Polkadot MainNet.

Click on the top left corner to open the menu to configure the networks, and then navigate down to open the Development sub-menu. In there, you will want to toggle the "Local Node" option, which points Polkadot JS Apps to ws://127.0.0.1:9944. Next, select the Switch button, and the site should connect to your Polkadex development node.
